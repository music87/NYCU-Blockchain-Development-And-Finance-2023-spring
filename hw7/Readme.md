    API_URL and API_KEY comes from Alchemy.
    PRIVATE_KEY and METAMSK_WALLET_ADDRESS is your one of metamask wallet's address and corresponding private key.
    ETHERSCAN_API_KEY comes from Etherscan.

3. Demo
   - Forking from mainnet & pinned the spesific block 17228670
   
      ```shell
         $ npx hardhat node --fork https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/<api_key> --fork-block-number 17228670
      ```

      or just run
         
      ```shell
      $ npx hardhat node
      ```

      since hardhat.config.js has set up the forking.

   - Build the abi of required contracts. The contract interface is written in contracts/contract_interfaces.sol
  
      ```shell
         $ npx hardhat compile
      ```

   - Run the test
      ```shell
      $ npx hardhat test scripts/test.js 
      ```

   -  What happens when Compound has no liquidity
      - [Print] the USDC balance in the Compound USDC contract
      - Alice provides liquidity (1000 USDC) into the Compound USDC contract
      - [Print] the USDC balance in the Compound USDC contract
      - Bob performs some setup â€¦ (think about it and try to figure out yourself!)
      - Bob withdraws all the USDC balance
      - [Print] the USDC balance in the Compound USDC contract, this should be 0, or a very small number close to 0
      - [Print] Alice tries to withdraw 1000 USDC, record what happened and print those out
